TAVERNmag: Thermodynamic Analysis and Volatile Equilibrium Reconstruction eNgine for magmatic gases

A Python library written by Kayla Iacovino after Iacovino (2015) for calculating the equilibrium state of H2O and CO2 in a silicate melt and/or 
magmatic fluid. Can be used to constrain degassing by calculating the equilibrium states of magma and fluid based on volcanic gas emission
data and data from melt inclusions.

This is a beta version and is a work in progress.
